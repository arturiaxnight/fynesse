## Features

- **Generate reccomendations** based on seed tracks and artists from your library or search results + 5 tuneable parameters provided by rhe recommendation API
- **Browse** your Spotify library (liked songs, playlists, recently played) and see artist genres associated with each track
- **Fine-grained search** for artists and tracks â€” by name, genre, year


## Connecting to Spotify API and running the app

The core functionality of spotifind requires a connection to Spotify's web API.

To set this up:
1. Go to the [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
1. Click `Create an app`
    - You now can see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
1. Click `Edit Settings`
1. Add `https://localhost:1234` to the Redirect URIs (or a port of your choice)
1. Scroll down and click `Save`
1. Add your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to [sp_secrets.py](sp_secrets.py)
1. You are now ready to run the app. Do so by running `reflex init` followed by `reflex run` in the [parent directory](/)
1. On first run, a browser window will open to a spotify authentication page. When you accept, you will be redirected to a URL beginning `https://localhost:1234` (if you kept default port)
1. The terminal session in which reflex is running will prompt you to `Enter the URL you were redirected to`; copy-paste the redirect url from your browser's address bar into the terminal and press enter.
1. The app should run, accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

#Tips for use
- have a flick through your library for some bangers
- plant them and/or their artists into the seeds window
- germinate the seeds to produce a batch of tune reccomendations
- experiment with the other generation parameters to fine tune your recommendations
- play/queue some/all of the recommended tunes
    - music is played via your active spotify device if you have one
    - **to play music from spotifind, you need to have a spotify client open somewhere - desktop, web, or mobile**
- save reccommended tunes to a playlist in your library to listen another time
- explore genres by showing them on your library and clicking to search
    - narrow down search to find similar tunes manually
- using a set of disparate seeds will produce a mixed playlist
- tunes can be played, queued or seeded from search results via each track's dropdown button
